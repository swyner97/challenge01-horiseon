# Code Refactor Starter Code

At first the HTML code contained missing alts and was semantically unorganized. Additionally, the CSS was very repetitive such that multiple separate selectors were denoting the same thing. 

I improved the code by adding alts, making sure the classes were doing what they were supposed to do in the CSS, used a variety of containers in an appropriate fashion such as div, section and aside. I also removed some ids that were not being utilized. 
Lastly, I had to move the side bar up the code so that it will appear in the correct place, next to the sections rather than under them.

For the CSS, I condensed the selectors that were repetitive into one selector and I renamed some classes to be a little more depictive of the purpose of the class for better understanding.
